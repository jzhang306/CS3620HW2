Analysis:
    Theoretically, Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF) tends to offer the best performance in terms of average turnaround time among the three.<br>
    This is because SRJF is a preemptive version of SJF, allowing the scheduler to switch to shorter tasks that arrive while a longer task is executing, thus reducing the average waiting time and, consequently, the average turnaround time.<br>
    Shortest Job First (SJF) can also perform well, especially in scenarios with a significant variation in burst times, but it doesn't adapt to new processes arriving with shorter burst times than the currently executing process.<br>
    First In First Out (FIFO) is the simplest and most straightforward but can suffer from the convoy effect, where short processes get stuck waiting behind long ones, leading to higher average turnaround times.<br>
    
    In conclusion, without running the program with a specific set of processes and measuring the outcomes, SRJF is expected to perform the best in terms of turnaround time due to its ability to preemptively switch to shorter tasks, minimizing waiting time for all processes.
