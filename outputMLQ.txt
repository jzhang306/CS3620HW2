Process Execution Order:

The high priority queue is scheduled by Round Robin.
The process ID 11 starts and has a response time: 0
The process ID 14 starts and has a response time: 1
The process id 11 completes, and has a turnaround time: 8
The process ID 17 starts and has a response time: 2
The process ID 20 starts and has a response time: 3
The process id 17 completes, and has a turnaround time: 15
The process id 14 completes, and has a turnaround time: 19
The process id 20 completes, and has a turnaround time: 18
The average turnaround time is 15.00, and the average response time is 1.50, using a Round Robin scheduling with a time quantum 2

The medium priority queue is scheduled by Round Robin.
The process ID 13 starts and has a response time: 25
The process ID 16 starts and has a response time: 24
The process ID 19 starts and has a response time: 23
The process id 13 completes, and has a turnaround time: 33
The process id 16 completes, and has a turnaround time: 36
The process id 19 completes, and has a turnaround time: 36
The average turnaround time is 35.00, and the average response time is 24.00, using a Round Robin scheduling with a time quantum 2

The low priority queue is scheduled by FIFO.
The process ID: 12 starts with a response time: 44, and completes with a turaround time: 50
The process ID: 15 starts with a response time: 49, and completes with a turaround time: 57
The process ID: 18 starts with a response time: 56, and completes with a turaround time: 60
The average turnaround time is: 55.67, The average response time is: 49.67
All processes complete.
